  "body": "### Kinect2Scratch\r\n\r\nKinect 2 Scratch makes it easy to make Kinect v2 (Xbox One version) games and applications in ScratchX, the easy to use programming environment from the Lifelong Kindergarten Lab in MIT. This is version 3 (2016), and the older (2011 and 2014) versions are [available](http://howell.azurewebsites.net/kinect2scratch), but [deprecated](http://scratch.saorog.com). This version has many more features, and it is recommended to upgrade if you can.\r\n\r\n###Prerequisites\r\n\r\nYou will need a PC with USB 3.0 and Windows 8, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. There is no Mac version because there are no Kinect v2 drivers for Mac. If you develop Kinect v2 body tracking drivers for the Mac, please let me know.\r\n\r\nYou will also need a Kinect v2. If you got one with your Xbox One, that will do fine, but you will need the Windows adaptor. Kinect v2 is available on online at the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Kinect-Sensor-for-Xbox-One/productID.2267482500) as well as the power/USB [adaptor](https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Kinect-Adapter-for-Windows/productID.308803600) for Windows which is purchased separately and is also required. \r\n\r\n###Setup Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Download and install [Kinect 2.0 Drivers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/download/details.aspx?id=44559)\r\n2. Plug in your Kinect to the wall (electricity) and PC (USB3), wait for your PC to finish installing the new device\r\n3. Download [Kinect2ScratchX3.exe](https://github.com/stephenhowell/kinect2scratch/releases/tag/3.0.1) and put it somewhere you'll find it again (doesn't need installing, just run it)\r\n4. Run Kinect2ScratchX3.exe (the file you just downloaded) and it may ask you to let it out through the firewall - this is because I use the network to send information from the Kinect to ScratchX.org. I don't send any other data (personal or otherwise) anywhere - just Kinect data to Scratch. Localhost and port 8181 is used, if this is an issue let me know.\r\n5. If you want to start from a fresh project, click [Launch ScratchX with new Kinect2Scratch project](http://scratchx.org/?url=http://stephenhowell.github.io/Kinect2ScratchX3.js#scratch). \r\n6. If you want to try the Skeleton sample project, click [Launch ScratchX with Kinect2Scratch Skeleton project](http://scratchx.org/?url=http://stephenhowell.github.io/Skeleton3.sbx#scratch)\r\n\r\nScratchX is Scratch 2.0 with some cloud features removed, but used because 3rd party extensions are allowed on ScratchX, but not on Scratch 2.0.\r\n\r\n###Coding\r\n\r\nThis is short, because I have to get on a plane and present this at the MIT Scratch Conference. To get you started, here are the blocks that are now available to you in Kinect2Scratch3:\r\n\r\n![Blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephenhowell/kinect2scratch/master/blocks.png)\r\n\r\n###Developer & Thanks\r\n\r\nHi! I'm Stephen Howell. I live in Ireland and was C++ developer for IBM, then a Computing lecturer and now Academic Evangelist for Microsoft. You can follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/saorog) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenrichardhowell) if you are so inclined. I first developed this in January 2011. Updated it a few times since. About 12,000 downloads later - thanks! I love the videos, tweets, emails and all the lovely feedback folk have sent. There are far too many people who have helped in developing and nurturing Kinect2Scratch, so thank you all. \r\n\r\nI will mention a few folks (and if they give their permission, I'll link to them):\r\n\r\n1. My family who put up with all the time coding and strange demands that they stand still in a line so the Kinect can see 6 people at once. Couldn't ask for better wife and kids.\r\n2. Teachers, educators and authors all over the world (Susan, Mags, Melanie, Bianca, Steve, Richard, Derek and many others)\r\n3. Microsoft Education and Microsoft Ireland Developer Evangelism Team\r\n\r\nThis version of Kinect2Scratch was built with the amazing [Vitruvius](https://github.com/LightBuzz/Vitruvius/) library by [Vangos Pterneas](http://pterneas.com/) from [LightBuzz](http://lightbuzz.com/). Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n### Support & Feedback\r\n\r\nHaving trouble? I don't have lots of free time (4 kids, wife, job, thesis) but I love to get feedback from you and I'll do my best to help if you get stuck; [email me](mailto://stephenhowell@outlook.com) and Iâ€™ll help you if I can.",
